- Add pagination to RDF
- clicking on pagination in listing displays resources in normal format, instead of keeping listing
- better formating for urls in current path
- error on button edit : if we put a data-content attribute, it stay displayed (bug semantic ui+react I think)

roadmap :
- patch doc error @type => rather go to model
- Finish backward linking on "/" for resource
- LATER think about how to allow for multiple links from a single element (ex. @type, or generate queries having
different operators), ex. rollover popup
- Think about a visual representation of resource -> otherResource.
