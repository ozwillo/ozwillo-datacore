About Ozwillo Datacore
--------------------

Ozwillo Datacore is a Cloud of shared Open Linked Data.

Its goal is cross-business data collaboration and integration. By linking data from different business together, it allows creating value by developing new Ozwillo services on top of it.

To interact and scale up, it uses Web technologies (HTTP REST API, OAuth2) and architecture (sharding and replication, client-side caching).
To achieve data model flexibility, it follows Semantic Web principles ("almost" W3C JSON-LD compatible), but curbed to fit real world constraints.

Features
   * HTTP REST API for sharing data, with OAuth2 authentication, client-side caching and Entity Tag-based optimistic locking
   * W3C JSON-LD-like data Resource representation, as well as RDF (nquads, turtle). Views allow outputting less fields.
   * W3C LDP-inspired query filters (logical operators including "between", regex, fulltext, pagination, MongoDB-inspired operators, capped)
   * Scalable MongoDB storage (replicated, sharded cluster-ready), Java server (Apache CXF 3 / Spring 3)
   * JSON Schema-like data models with Model (primary) and Mixin (reusable) types. Models are the place where collaboration on data happens.
   * Supported field types are string, boolean, int, float, long, double, date (ISO8601), map, list, i18n (optimized for search on value only), resource (i.e. link).
   * Similar models inheriting from the same storage model are stored in it and can be queried together. Fields may be indexed, fulltext, aliased, readonly, required, have a default value. Along with Mixins and Views, it allows multiple point of views.
   * Models and Projects (business sets of Models and their Resources) are themselves stored as Resources and can be updated live using Datacore API. Models (and therefore also individual Resources) can be forked in order to try out new versions of them, without hampering query performance thanks to a single multi-project storage of Models.
   * Rights (readers, writers, owners) at Resource, Mixin (View), Model and Project levels, with query optimization
   * Historization, allowing a posteriori moderation
   * Approvable changes (a priori moderation), up to Contributions (merging Resources from other similar Models)
   * Client libraries (see details below) : CXF3/Spring3/Java, Spring4/Java (Portal's), Javascript (swagger.js), and all languages that Swagger generates to (see corresponding Swagger projects).
   
Tools
   * Online API Playground. Features documentation, live business as well as technical examples, sandbox, drill down and (back) links browsing, thanks to a data Resource management tool that also allows managing Projects, Models and their governance (rights, Model freeze). Also allows explaining queries execution, including showing owned Resources as stored even if obsolete. Besides, features a developer-only technical REST Playground (Swagger UI).
   * Online model & data Import tool. Input is CSV files, which allows easy refactoring. Supports bulk import up to thousands of fields and Resources, detailed error output, rePOST on conflict, skip when forbidden, all field types (including multiple language import), all model features save for rights definition, URI generation out of ID fields including links, computation of ancestors out of those, auto & ID-based & query-based linking, Javascript field generation including random.
   
See [Roadmap](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/issues) for upcoming features.

Getting Started with the server
-------------------------------

Requirements : [Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), [MongoDB 2.6](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

Build ([Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) required) : at root, do : mvn clean install

Deployment : go in the ozwillo-datacore-web subproject and do `mvn jetty:run`

Then go have a look at API documentation and playground at [http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/index.html). To try it out, for instance do a GET ``/dc/type/geo:Area_0`` to see what geographical areas (cities...) are available. To learn more about available operations, follow the [wiki Playground tutorial](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/wiki/Playground-&-Import-UI-demo-scenario---Provto-&-OpenElec) and do the [city & country Tutorial](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/wiki/Tutorial---city-&-country). To learn about out to use them, have a look at the detailed API doc below.

Alternatively, to deploy it in production ([Tomcat 7](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi) required) : put the war contents in a tomcat 7 root and start it :

    cd tomcat7/bin
    cp -rf ../../workspace/ozwillo-datacore/ozwillo-datacore-web/target/datacore/* ../webapps/ROOT/
    ./catalina.sh start


Adding Business Configuration
-----------------------------

To use Datacore for your own collaborative data use case, you must define the appropriate business-specific Models.

The preferred way is to use the Datacore online Import tool at [http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/import/index.html](http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/import/index.html). Follow the steps described in the [wiki Import tutorial](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/wiki/Playground-&-Import-UI-demo-scenario---Provto-&-OpenElec).

This can also be done in Java. Do it in a new class on the model of [MarkaInvestModel](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/blob/master/ozwillo-datacore-rest-server/src/main/java/org/oasis/datacore/sample/MarkaInvestModel.java) or [CityCountrySample](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/blob/master/ozwillo-datacore-rest-server/src/main/java/org/oasis/datacore/sample/CityCountrySample.java) (meaning a server-side class, auto initialized by annotating it by @Component, using Spring-injected DataModelServiceImpl and DatacoreApi or DCEntityService, or if they are not enough yet MongoOperations). Sample data for these models can be added using the Datacore REST API obviously, or again using Java in a new class on the model of [MarkaInvestData](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/blob/master/ozwillo-datacore-rest-server/src/main/java/org/oasis/datacore/sample/MarkaInvestData.java).

For more samples and Model reference documentation, have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/wiki).


Using it from a client business application
-------------------------------------------

Use the JSON/HTTP client of your own business application's platform and / or of your choice to call the DatacoreApi server using REST JSON/HTTP calls. Learn about all available operations and their parameters in the API documentation below the playground at [http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/index.html), in the dedicated detailed panels such as the one that opens when clicking on [http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/index.html#!/dc/findDataInType_get_2](http://localhost:8080/dc-ui/index.html#!/dc/findDataInType_get_2).

Here are such clients that might help you :

- A **Java JAXRS 2 proxy-like cached client built on the CXF service engine** is provided by the [ozwillo-datacore-rest-cxf](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/blob/master/ozwillo-datacore-rest-cxf) subproject. Use it by [loading its Spring](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/blob/master/ozwillo-datacore-rest-cxf/src/main/resources/oasis-datacore-rest-client-context.xml) and injecting DatacoreCachedClient using ```@Autowired private DatacoreCachedClient datacoreApi;``` like done in [this test](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/blob/master/ozwillo-datacore-rest-cxf/src/test/java/org/oasis/datacore/rest/api/client/DatacoreApiCXFClientTest.java).

- A **simpler Java client built on Spring 4 with REST Template** is provided, along with a similar Kernel client, by the [ozwillo-java-spring-integration](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-java-spring-integration) top-level project. See how the portal [uses it to query geographical Resource](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-portal/blob/master/src/main/java/org/oasis_eu/portal/core/mongo/dao/geo/GeographicalAreaCache.java#L226) and [how it configures it](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-portal/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yml#L88).

- If it doesn't suit you, **other Java service engines** (such as Jersey, RESTEasy) may be used in similar fashion, though some features (HTTP ETag-based caching, generic query request) require developing interceptors / handlers / filters. Otherwise, the **Java JAXRS web client** works well with the DatacoreApi and allows to do everything, though it is a bit more "barebone".

- in Javascript, you can use either the [swagger.js library](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js) (works also in node.js) :

    window.datacoreSwaggerApi = new SwaggerApi({url: "http://localhost:8080/api-docs"});
    datacoreSwaggerApi.build();
    successCallback = function(data) { alert("received " + data.content.data); }
    ...
    datacoreSwaggerApi.apis.city.findDataInType({type:"sample.city.city", name:"London"},  successCallback);

or jQuery [like Citizen Kin did at some time](https://github.com/ozwillo/oasis-citizenkin/blob/master/oasis-citizenkin-parent/oasis-citizenkin-webapp-back/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/permissions.jsp) :

    $.get(datacoreRestClientBaseurl + "dc/type/sample.citizenkin.user" + "?lastName=" + encodeURIComponent("Smith"), callback))

- In other languages, you can use [Swagger codegen](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen) to generate DatacoreApi clients to various languages : **php, ruby, python, Objective C, Flash...**

At worst, you can talk to DatacoreApi server by writing the right JSON/HTTP requests, sending them to it and handling their responses.


Tips for integrating it in a client business application, from a functional point of view
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **painless data replacement** - put static data in the Datacore : all static data, such as a list of region names contained in a property file, or authorized values for a field in the database that are hardcoded in business code, can easily and without further impact be replaced by a heavily (each week, sync unless performance problems) globally cached call to Datacore.
- **painless data linking** - to integrate free form data (such as common information input forms) with Datacore data : use a suggestion UI component (such as select2 in Javascript), so that the user will be inclined to choose one already existing (in the Datacore !) item, rather than typing it all out with the risks of typing mistakes or adding a redundant but slightly differently worded value. This way, we are reusing the user's knowledge to link data, rather than having to reprocess it all afterwards. And the business database has not to be structured or constrained any further than adding a column for linked Datacore Resources.
- **easy data dynamic upload** - best practices to upload your data from your application : beyond initial manual data import using ex. Datacore online Import tool while designing models, when your application has to upload data, be it in a startup / management phase or during a user request, do for each piece of data in your database :
 - 1. if it already has a value in its newly added Datacore Resource URI column, GET it, if version is up to date you're ready to upload (don't forget to upgrade your local Datacore Resource version column afterwards), otherwise handle conflict (see later).
 - 2. else try to find a corresponding Resource that already exists in the Datacore, either by building its id (if not blackbox) out of fields (using indexInId model property) and doing a GET on its URI, or by looking it up using one or more query on deduplicating fields (defined in queryNames model property). If found, store URI and handle conflict (see later), else build a new id if not done yet, store URI and upload (don't forget to set your local Datacore Resource version column to 0 afterwards).
- handling conflict : online tools are being developed for that. Until then, or if they don't fit for you, you have to develop your own, at worst by adding below your data form two links : "view local version", "view remote version", and a button "choose this one".


Documentation
--------------

See online API (ask URL to Ozwillo or run your own local Datacore) and its packaged examples, [wiki](https://github.com/ozwillo/ozwillo-datacore/wiki) and Java tests.

Documentation still can be improved. If something is missing, ask us about it. Especially missing is a more formal description of supported data resources : what field types are supported, how to model them, how they behave (especially Map, List and external vs embedded Resource fields types) ; and wider, documentation of the metamodel itself : field types, Mixin (light, reusable, multiple) types and inheritance, security and mediation configuration...


Administration & development FAQ
--------------------------------

How to test Playground handling of historization, encoded uri, post/put, mass delete : create a Resource with a NON-ASCII character in its URI in a historized model such as sample.marka.company in the oasis.samples project (example below), post/ put it a few times, look at historized resources using the H button, click on the slash before the URI id to generate a query that returns several Resources and click on X button :

````javascript
   {
      "@id": "http://data.ozwillo.com/dc/type/sample.marka.company/Company√©1",
      "@type": [
         "sample.marka.company"
      ],
      "name": "Company√©1",
      "id": 1
   }   
````

How to test Playground import : import the OpenElec sample, the results should be :

````
Handled 8 models or mixins in 2 loops   Posted 8 models or mixins (skipped 0, no error)...
...
Handled 17 rows (43 errors) in 0s   Posted 41 resources (skipped 0, no error)...
````

How to test OAuth2 in development against preprod : in deploy properties change kernel & accound URLs and secret (but don't commit it !!), restart, go the Playground page, login using a preprod user, check that the Playground still works (and in HTTP requests for Bearer in the Authorization header, after enabling web development tools)




**MongoDB tips** :

List models in a given collection (here the metamodel) :

````js
db["oasis.meta.dcmi:mixin_0"].find().forEach(function(e) { print(e['_p']['dcmo:name'], e['_b']); })
````

Display (all branch versions of) one model :

````js
db["oasis.meta.dcmi:mixin_0"].find({ "_p.dcmo:name":"org2:Organization_0" })
````

Upgrade error "Index with name: _uri already exists with different options" : delete the dCEntity dummy collection

````js
db["dCEntity"].drop()
````
